# Travelling-salesman-lexicography
## A project to visualize solution of the travelling salesman problem

Brute force approach is used to get the solution, which is limited to smaller number of cities (points).

This limitation is taken care of in [The Travelling Salesman problem using Genetic Algorithm](https://github.com/sanskarjaiswal2001/Travelling-Salesman-Genetic-Algorithm).

**Try it out here :** [The Travelling Salesman problem using lexicography](https://sanskarjaiswal2001.github.io/Travelling-salesman-lexicography/)
